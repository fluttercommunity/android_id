![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/android_id)

A Flutter plugin for retrieving the Android ID.

## Getting started

* Add plugin to pubspec.yaml
* Use it in your code (see examples of all methods below)

## Usage

```dart
const _androidIdPlugin = AndroidId();

final String? androidId = await _androidIdPlugin.getId();
```

## Important

Please note that on `Android 8` and above, the `Android ID` is not only unique per device, but also per signing key the app was built with:

<blockquote>
On Android 8.0 (API level 26) and higher versions of the platform, a 64-bit number (expressed as a hexadecimal string), <b>unique to each combination of app-signing key, user, and device.</b>

The value may change if a factory reset is performed on the device or if an APK signing key changes.
</blockquote>
